Problem: Global array of structs has always values of 0s

Found:
- data segment not copied properly to RAM
  - don't copy RAM to RAM
  - copy data from FLASH to RAM (meant to be copied to RAM)
  - usually linker script has "sidata" section which represents that
  - sidata (in flash) is placed after .text
  - has the same address as end of .text:
    - &__section_idata_start == &__section_text_end

- bug when setting BSS segment to 0
 - was set to start copy from &__section_data_start

# linker script:
- .data
+ .data : AT ( __section_idata_start )

# startup code:
src = &__section_idata_start;
dst = &__section_data_start;
while (dst < &__section_data_end)
{
	*(dst++) = *(src++);
}

dst = &__section_bss_start;
while (dst < &__section_bss_end)
{
	*(dst++) = 0;
}
