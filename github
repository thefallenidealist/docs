curl -u 'USER@gmail.com' https://api.github.com/user/repos -d '{"name":"REPO"}'
git remote add origin https://github.com:USER/REPO.git	# USERNAME not mail
git push origin master


# problem: can not push:
git push origin my-branch
	git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).
	fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
# fix:
# use https instead of ssh
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY
# if that not works:
git push --set-upstream origin master
