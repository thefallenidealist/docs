One Single-Link DVI-D digital monitor supporting 1920 x 1200 resolution
One DisplayPort monitor supporting 2560 x 1600 resoltion

For a Lenovo T430 Maximum external resolution:
    2560x1600@60Hz (DisplayPort via optional Mini DP cable)
    1920x1200@60Hz (single-link DVI-I via optional Mini DP cable)
    2048x1536@75Hz (VGA)

# ultrawide screen
# 3440 x 1440
I'm using a X220 with a Dell 34 curved with this resolution by default... no issues...


# hacks
Is 3840x2160@25hz (with reduced blanking).
  supporting 4K (3840x2160). I'm writing this from a T430s on a 4K display.

# triple monitor
- possible if external 2xDP is used
- internal LCD is not connected to DP
- FHD mod chip - convert eDP panel to LVDS so it should be OK? # TODO 191020
I currently run 3 external monitors using the Mini Dock Series 3.  1->DVI (dock), 2->DP (dock), 3->miniDP (laptop, using a miniDP->DP cable).
I also verified that I can use the DP+miniDP+ internal laptop LCD, but that I cannot use DP+DVI+internal.


# multimonitor or single ultrawide?
- multimonitor setup better for productivity
- better for multitasking with maximized video on one screen

- single ultrawide better for viewing videos
- no "giant bezels" in the middle


#  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dell 22-24" FHD should be more than enough
# 191121 one month of using U24:
- black background is not that dark in comparison with laptop LCD
- can be smaller, especially on shallow desk (65 cm)
- resolution could be bigger (only visible at closeup)
- image at edges little darkish - fault of thiny bezels?
- 250 cd of backlight is enough, problem for me that is too bright at 0% (in lighted room)
= not bad monitor, not that big, not that dark, can be used for programming, definitily can have more contrast
