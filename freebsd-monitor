# 200530
# FreeBSD 12.1-RELEASE
# ThinkPad T430s CoreBoot, monitors on dock or monitor on miniDP -> (DP or HDMI) adapter

connecting and disconnecting DP cable on the dock doesn't generate anything:
- on devd			(only change was ACPI event 0x81 (acpi_thermal))
- sysctl hw.acpi.	(only change was temperature)

Linux on the same laptop (Debian 10) will recognize connecting/disconnecting
- polling (xrandr?) status?
