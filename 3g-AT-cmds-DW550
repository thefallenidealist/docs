AT*: List all supported AT commands (described in Sony AT commands document)
ATA: Answer incoming call command (described in Sony AT commands document)
AT+BRSF: Bluetootth retrieve supported (described in Sony AT commands document)
AT&C : Circuit 109 (DCD) control (described in Sony AT commands document)
AT+CACM: Accumulated Call meter (described in Sony AT commands document)
AT+CAMM: Accumulated call meter maximum (described in Sony AT commands document)
AT+CAOC: Advice of charge (described in Sony AT commands document)
AT+CBC: Battery charge (ver. 2) (described in Sony AT commands document)
AT+CBST: Select Bearer Service Type (ver. 3) (described in Sony AT commands document)
AT+CCFC: Calling forwarding number and conditions (ver. 2) (described in Sony AT commands document)
AT+CCLK: Clock (ver. 4) (described in Sony AT commands document)
AT+CCWA: Call waiting (ver .2) (described in Sony AT commands document)
AT+CDIP: Called line identification presentation (described in Sony AT commands document)
AT+CEAP: Seems useless. AT+CEAP=? just returns ok. AT+CEAP? returns ERROR
AT+CEER: Extended error report (ver. 2) (described in Sony AT commands document)
AT+CFUN: Set phone functionality (ver .2) (described in Sony AT commands document)

    0 Minimum functionality, that is, the phone is turned off. Default value
    1 Full functionality, that is, the phone is turned on
    2 Disable phone transmit RF circuits only. Not supported
    3 Disable phone receive RF circuits only. Not supported
    4 Disable phone transmit and receive RF circuits. Note: This is often referred to as "flight mode"
    5 GSM only (WCDMA radio off)
    6 WCDMA only (GSM radio off)

	Issuing an AT+CFUN=5 makes 3G unavailable and the connections happen in GPRS. On the contrary, issuing an AT+CFUN=6 prevents GPRS connections (which may mean no connection at all if min connection requirements are not met).

AT+CGACT: PDP context activate or deactivate (described in Sony AT commands document)
AT+CGATT: Packet service attach or detach (described in Sony AT commands document)
AT+CGCLASS: see AT_CMD_GPRS.pdf for some reference. But the command seems pretty pointless in our case: the card reports a single possible value ("A") and only accepts that value, i.e. returning "ERROR" in other cases.
AT+CGCMOD: PDP context modify (described in Sony AT commands document)
AT+CGDATA: Enter data state (described in Sony AT commands document)
AT+CGDCONT: Define PDP context (ver. 1) (described in Sony AT commands document)

AT*E2CFUN: The prototype of the command as reported by the device is the following:

		AT*E2CFUN=?
		*E2CFUN: (0-1)

		OK

		The command can be used to enable/disable asynchronous notification of change in Phone Functionality. This is best explained with examples:

		AT+CFUN=6                        << Force WCDMA mode only
		OK

		AT*E2CFUN?                       << Ask for current status. Reports 6,
		*E2CFUN: 0,6,0                   << i.e. WCDMA mode only.

		OK

		AT+CFUN=5                        << Force GPRS mode only
		OK

		AT*E2CFUN?                       << Ask for current status. Reports 5,
		*E2CFUN: 0,5,0                   << i.e. GPRS only

		OK

		AT+CFUN=1                        << Force full mode
		OK

		AT*E2CFUN?                       << Ask for current status. Reports 1,
		*E2CFUN: 0,1,0                   << i.e. full mode

		OK

		AT*E2CFUN=1                      << Force asynchronous notification
		OK

		AT+CFUN=6                        << Change mode from 1 to 6
		OK

		*E2CFUN: 1,6,0                   << Asynchronous notification. New
											mode is 6 (first value is now 1,
											indicating async. notification
											is enabled
		AT*E2CFUN only accept 0 or 1 as parameter (when a value is provided). This is in fact the value of the mode, i.e. the first paramater returned when issuing an AT*E2CFUN. When the mode is set to value 1, the card returns *E2CFUN: X,Y,Z value when the phone functionality level is changed. For instance, a showed in previous example, when setting the level back to 6 using AT+CFUN, an *E2CFUN: 1,6,0.
		XXX I have currently no clue on the purpose and meaning of last paramater.
AT*E2CHAN: Returns UMTS channel information.

	AT*E2CHAN=?
	*E2CHAN: (0-1),(0-1)

	OK
